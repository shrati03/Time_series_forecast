Time Series is the method of predicting the future values based on previously collected equally spaced data intervals.
From the provided information, meaning statistics can be done and meaningful information can be extracted from the data particularly about future occurences.
The data we will use is Saudi Arabia Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation data from 0 – 355 recording the number of disease per year.
The data has been imported from the — KAPSARC Data Portal
About ARIMA MODEL:
1. **Components:** ARIMA combines AutoRegressive, Integrated, and Moving Average components.

2. **Stationarity:** It requires a stationary time series; differencing is applied if needed.

3. **Order Selection:** Defined by (p, d, q), where p is AR order, d is differencing, and q is MA order.

4. **Forecasting:** Widely used for predicting future values based on identified time series patterns.

5. **Assumptions:** Assumes constant patterns over time, may not perform well with evolving trends.
Finally, accuracy is evaluated using the MSE values.
